# Linear-Regression-SageMaker-Linear-Learner
A Linear Regression model that could accurately predict employee salary based on number of years of experience. </br>
</br>
Linear Regression Intuition: In Simple Linear Regression, we predict the value of one variable Y based on another vairable X. X is called the independent vairable and Y is called the dependent variable. When the independent variable increases (or decreses), the dependent variable increses (or decreses) in a linear fashion.

</br> We'll put the data points and our objective will be to come up with a linear straight line. Goal is to obtain a relationship b/w employee salary and number of years of experience.

```bash
  y=mx+b                  //where "m" is the slope of graph and x, y are cordinates.
```
